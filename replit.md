# Overview

This is a recipe management web application built with Angular 19 that helps users manage their fridge ingredients, discover recipes, plan meals, and create shopping lists. The application integrates with Google's Gemini AI for recipe generation and Firebase for authentication and data persistence. It features a gamification system with points and levels, multilingual support (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian), and a subscription-based premium model.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Angular 19 standalone components with reactive signals
- Uses standalone components exclusively (no NgModules for components)
- Implements Angular's new signal-based reactivity for state management
- Change detection strategy relies on signals and computed values
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling approach

**Component Structure**:
- `AppComponent`: Main container orchestrating authentication state and view navigation
- Feature components: Home (meal planner), Fridge (ingredient input), Suggestions (recipe display), Shopping List, Profile
- Utility components: Paywall (subscription prompt), Language Selector
- All components are self-contained with their own templates and imports

**State Management**:
- Signal-based reactive state throughout the application
- No centralized state management library
- Services expose signals for components to consume
- Parent-to-child communication via `@Input()`, child-to-parent via `@Output()` EventEmitters

**Internationalization**:
- Custom translation system using `TranslationService` and `TranslatePipe`
- Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian
- Translation keys stored in service, not external files
- Language selection persists in signal state

## Backend Architecture

**Firebase Integration**:
- Firebase Authentication handles user authentication (Google OAuth, email/password)
- Cloud Firestore stores user data, meal plans, and shopping lists
- Firebase configuration embedded directly in service files using project `chef-ai-b08d8`
- Configured with real Firebase credentials from google-services.json
- Separate app instances for Auth and Firestore to avoid initialization conflicts

**Authentication Flow**:
- `AuthService` manages authentication state using Firebase Auth SDK
- Maintains `currentUser` signal updated via `onAuthStateChanged` listener
- Triggers Firestore data loading on successful authentication
- Supports Google Sign-In popup and traditional email/password authentication

**Data Storage**:
- `FirestoreService` manages all database operations
- User documents structure: `{ uid, email, points, level, mealPlan, shoppingList, createdAt }`
- Meal plans organized by days of week (Monday-Sunday)
- Shopping list items stored as `{ text: string, checked: boolean }`

**AI Recipe Generation**:
- `GeminiService` integrates with Google's Generative AI API
- Uses `gemini-pro` model for recipe generation
- Falls back to mock data when API key not configured
- Generates structured recipe objects with title, description, ingredients, instructions, prep time, servings

## Data Models

**User Model** (`UserData`):
- Core user properties: uid, email, points, level, creation timestamp
- Nested meal plan object with arrays of recipe names per day
- Shopping list as array of items with text and checked status

**Recipe Model**:
- Title, description, ingredients (string array), instructions (string array)
- Metadata: prep time, number of servings
- Generated by AI or provided as mock data

**Meal Plan Structure**:
- Seven-day structure with empty arrays as default
- Each day can contain multiple recipe names (strings)
- Days referenced by lowercase keys: 'monday', 'tuesday', etc.

## External Dependencies

**Firebase Services** (v11.1.0):
- Firebase App: Core initialization
- Firebase Auth: User authentication with Google OAuth and email/password providers
- Cloud Firestore: NoSQL document database for user data persistence
- Project ID: `chef-ai-b08d8`

**Google Generative AI** (@google/generative-ai v0.21.0):
- Gemini Pro model for recipe generation
- Structured prompt engineering for JSON recipe responses
- Uses placeholder API key ('demo-key') - update with real key to enable AI recipe generation
- Falls back to mock recipes when API key not configured

**Angular Ecosystem** (v19.0.0):
- @angular/core: Framework foundation with signals and standalone components
- @angular/common: Common directives and pipes
- @angular/forms: Template-driven and reactive forms support
- @angular/platform-browser: Browser-specific implementations

**Styling Framework**:
- TailwindCSS v3.4.0: Utility-first CSS framework
- PostCSS and Autoprefixer for processing
- Custom configuration in `tailwind.config.js` scanning all HTML and TypeScript files

**Development Tools**:
- TypeScript 5.6.2 with strict mode enabled
- Angular CLI for build and development server
- Development server configured for host `0.0.0.0:5000` with disabled host checking

**Subscription Management**:
- `SubscriptionService` provides basic subscription state
- Currently stubbed implementation (always returns subscribed state)
- Designed for future integration with payment provider
